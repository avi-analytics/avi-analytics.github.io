                                &lt;p&gt;Union Budget is a gold mine of data and information. Useful information is often buried deep in it&amp;#8217;s cracks and crevices. I ferret out
a few numbers and graphs to compare projected tax collection and expenditure growth rate patterns with last year&amp;#8217;s actual figures.
&lt;img alt=&#34;GitHub Logo&#34; src=&#34;/media/images/tax1.png&#34; /&gt;
Total annual expenditure of central government is
budgeted at &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;INR&lt;/span&gt; 2.1 trillion which is a meagre 6.56% higher than last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure should be contrasted with last yearâ€™s increase of around 12.48 percentage points.
Ranking major items by percentage increase in public spending reveals interesting patterns. Health, Energy, Transport, Social Welfare,
and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; have received above-average allocations; while Agriculture and Allied
sectors, Defense, and Education have received average allocations. Agriculture and Allied sectors and Development of North East are interesting items where allocation has been sharply reduced in relative terms.
